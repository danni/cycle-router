cycle-router
============

This project aims to become a model for optimising cycling routes by finding
temporal changes in velocity anomolies and connecting them to things we can
forecast (like winds). Currently it is an investigation into this process.

People may find rk.py useful, which is a Python module to talk the RunKeeper
API. Please use your own client ID and client secret if you use this module.

Thanks :)
